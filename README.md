# Trello Clone

Front-end of a single page Kanban style web application (SPA) similar to Trello.

## Technologies used 

• React, CSS, Redux/redux-thunk and React Hooks for state management, React Router, and authorization with JWT's.

• The app is connected to an [API](https://github.com/RyanNicoletti/trello-clone-api) that I built with Node.js, Express, and         PostgreSQL.
